# <Module 1 Challenge>

## Description

This project was designed to prepare me for a scenario that I would likely encounter on my journey to becoming a web developer. This project was built from a starter code and needed to be refactored because one of the links was not functioning properly. I reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties and organized them to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements. I also added comments before each element that I changed to explain what I did.
